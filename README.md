OMG just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Another Simple Favor, and girl, what a trip! Didn't expect to be so tangled in a web of almost-a-thriller vibes, you know what I mean? Like, it’s not even trying to be a thriller, but still keeps you guessing. Anna Kendrick just does these awkward-too-confident characters so well, seriously, like she nails it every freakin’ time.

And Blake Lively, her outfits? I die! Like, part of me just wants to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just for fashion tips, haha! Also, wanna point out how jarring it is to see that whole charming suburban mom turned... whatever that was? It’s like Stepford Wives meets Gone Girl, but with this tongue-in-cheek flair. I'm here for it, even though by the end I was borderline confused. 

> At one point, I was legit thinking, “Wait, did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the same scene twice or are they messing with me?” You ever get that feeling where you can’t quite piece together if it’s the   or if you're just tired? Maybe a mix of both, haha. But anyway, totally worth the 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, kept my brain just on edge enough while still half-chilling with my evening snack.

Oh and the music, forgot to mention that jazzy soundtrack, feels like it belongs in one of those speakeasy bars. Gives the whole thing this vibe where you’re half expecting some noir detective to show up and be like, “This ain’t your story, kid.”

So next time you’re thinking about what to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   on a lazy weekend, seriously give this one a try. It’s like, what, two hours? But it doesn’t feel like it drags at all. Keeps you up asking all sorts of whys and hows, while you’re sipping on whatever it is you’re trying to call coffee nowadays, haha.

console.log(totally unrelated bit of code here); like how did that even end up in this convo? Anyway! Maybe I need to actually sleep or something. Probably dreaming of Blake’s suits... or maybe start sketching some of those sharp lines into new ink designs. Catch ya later, gotta crash before my brain just fizzles out completely!
